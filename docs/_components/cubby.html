  <p>Cubby is an evolution UI component that attempts to make displaying tabular data a little more space efficient.  It does this by hiding part of the content in a `&lt;td&gt;` element with the class of `.evo_c-cubby` in a `&lt;table&gt;` behind other data.  Content within the `&lt;td class=&quot;evo_c-cubby&quot;&gt;` tag is split into two `&lt;div&gt;`s, the first with a class of `.evo_c-cubby__door` and the second with a class of `.evo_c-cubby__inside`.  On hovering of the `&lt;td&gt;` cell, it creates the effect of a door swinging open to reveal the hidden content behind the first `&lt;div class=&quot;evo_c-cubby__door&quot;&gt;` tag.  This component requires no JavaScript.

  One limitation of this component is that it requires `hover` to be firing within the client which may make it unsuitable for mobile uses.  Also, the content of both `&lt;div&gt;`s should be about the same amout to prevent content in `inside` to peak out from behind content from `door` until this can be remedied.</p>
