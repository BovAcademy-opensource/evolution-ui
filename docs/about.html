<h2>Welcome, and thank you for visiting!</h2>
<br />
The first of its kind, Evolution UI is an open source front-end web framework comprising a collection of innovative and unique web components. These never-before-seen web components are intended to provide a different and enriched online experience to their users and were created by the <a href="https://students.bovacademy.com/" target="_blank">students of Bov Academy Institute of Programming and Futuristic Engineering.</a> This framework is intended to be a hub of web development innovation and we invite everyone to explore their own creativity and contribute something of their own to keep the project thriving.
<br /><br />
While some of the components are still in development, many are ready for production. The components have been developed with HTML, CSS, Sass, and vanilla JavaScript.
<br /><br />
The site you are viewing is a showcase site for all of the components constituting the Evolution framework. Here, you can browse the various components and view the source HTML behind each one. You can also learn about bit about the framework's maintainers; please feel free to rach out to any one of us with questions, comments, or to get involved with the framework!
