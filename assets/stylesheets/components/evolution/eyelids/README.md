# Evolution UI Framework Component - Eyelids

### What is Eyelids?

Eyelids is an innovative web component that can be useful to the people who read a lot on the computer screen. It helps you focus on the text or other content in cases of pages with a long chunks of text, or even to help cover up the distracting parts of the complex web page. To use it, just hit `Ctrl + 1` on the keyboard. The eyelids will close down vertically on your mouse position and will follow its movement allowing you a clean horizontal area for better focus on the content. To dismiss it, just hit `Ctrl + 1` again or `Esc` key. Optionally, you can add the eyelids notifier on the page with the following code:

```html
<!-- This notification element is optional -->
<div class="evo_c-eyelids-notification">
  <p>Use "Eyelids" on this page:</p>
  <code class="evo_code"><!-- Don't add any content here, this will be populated by the
      JavaScript with the shortcut code for activating Eyelids --></code>
</div>
```

**Eyelids has the capability to adjust the width of the highlighted area on the screen. To do that, press `Shift` key and scroll with your mousewheel.**
