##Naviator Element

This element is for navigating through a page, hence the name "Naviator". The short arrows will allow the user to navigate to the next or previous section, while the long arrows will allow the user to navigate to the bottom or back to the top.

To use, simply copy/paste the code.

Additionally, you must link to the [FontAwesome](https://www.fontawesome.io) library. To do so, copy/paste the following script in your HTML file:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">`

Note that the code here navigates from <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> headers. It could be rewritten to navigate between <code> sections </code> or <code> divs</code>. The element will automatically work with whatever tag you want it to.
