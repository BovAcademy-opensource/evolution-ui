<div class="evo_c-divtable-small_placeholder">
    <input type="text" name="Name" id="evo_c-divtable-search_input" placeholder="Search User">
</div>

<div class="evo_c-divtable-container" id="evo_c-divtable-tableContainer">
</div>

```


### Upcoming Features

- When the table is very long vertically (many records), part of the table will shrink
- Sticky headers; when the user scrolls, fix the header row at the top of the window so that the user can see the label for each column.
- Please request more features or report any issues.
